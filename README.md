# Language R ML
This is a native interface to an alpha version of a Language ML API service.

In its simplified form, this is an expanded version of Maximum likelihood model called Max Entropy:<br/>

## R Examples (release date: TBD):
```r
library(languageRml)
entropy('Hello, we are on a mission to change written communication.')
```

```r
## [1] "Result"        "driven"        "Passive voice" "Concise"      
## [5] "Informal"      "Thoughtful"    "Assertive"
```

```r
entropy("Don't get us wrong, we love existing tools such as Gmail and Slack. Yet, we believe that our communication is poor (Emojis - come on...). We are capable of much more!")
```

```r
## [1] "Thoughtful" "Inormal"   "Verbose"
```

## Try It Now

We see most useful use cases for this arise in chat/email correspondence, so **demo is done through a chat interface** as well (Wire company is of no affiliation - just using them as an alternative to popular social media apps).

**Steps:**

1. Register a new temporary user on [app.wire.com](https://app.wire.com/auth/#register)
2. Follow all the usual wire's activation procedures *(i.e. email confirmation - Sorry!)*
3. Enable the bot by clicking here: [caura.co/entropy-ai](https://www.caura.co/entropy-ai)

## How To Stay Up To Date

**EQ engine** - updates are handled by Caura & Co.<br>
**Wire SDK** - see Wire link above for this git repo for updates to their SDK<br>
**Availability** - the server running LanguageRml service cannot currently handle large volumes. You might experience some of our throttling until we distribute the workload
