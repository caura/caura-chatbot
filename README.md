# Language AI
This is a native interface to an alpha version of a Language ML API service.

In its simplified form, this is an expanded version of Maximum likelihood model called Max Entropy:<br/>

## R Examples (release date: TBD):
```r
library(languageML)
entropy('Hello, we are on a mission to change written communication.')
```

```r
## [1] "Result"        "driven"        "Passive voice" "Concise"      
## [5] "Informal"      "Thoughtful"    "Assertive"
```

```r
entropy("Don't get us wrong, we love existing tools such as Gmail and Slack. Yet, we believe that our communication is poor (Emojis - come on...). We are capable of much more!")
```

```r
## [1] "Thoughtful" "Inormal"   "Verbose"
```
